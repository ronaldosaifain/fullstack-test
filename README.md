# Fullstack Test

## Context

Gobots wants to create a new service to suggest music to its users. The suggestions will depend on the city and the climate where the user is.

## Task

Create a micro-service able to accept RESTful requests receiving as parameter a location and returns a playlist suggestion according to the current temperature. Use any language and framework you want (Kotlin/Java + Spring, Python + Django/Flask etc), however Kotlin + Spring is recommended.

Also create a simple frontend which sends the location to the microservice and shows the music suggestions. Use any language and framework you want (JQuery, ReactJS, Angular etc).

## How to run it
1 - Install backend, frontend and auth dependencies by running npm i on their directories.
2 - Start the backend(/back)npm start run and auth(/auth/authorization)node app.js server on their directories.
3 - Start the frontend serve (front) npm run serve
